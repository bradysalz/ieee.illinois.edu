        <h3 class="orange-text" id="projects">Projects Committee</h3>
        <p>The Projects Committee allows you get involved by working on your own projects, potentially getting funding for them, or finding others to work on projects together. We work with other organizations like iRobotics and ECE Pulse as well.</p>

        <h3 class="orange-text" id="workshops">Workshops Committee</h3>
        <p>The Workshops Committee creates and organizes general purpose workshops for all students. In years past these included the Arduino and soldering workshos. They also allow IEEE to maintain a strong presence at EOH, the Projects Fair, and other such events. </p>

        <h3 class="orange-text" id="jsdc">JSDC Team</h3>
        <p>The Jerry Sanders Design Competition is an annual robotics design competition held at UIUC, hosting various universities from from across the midwest. IEEE has a JSDC team that competes every year by building a robot as a team. For more information, <a href="http://jsdc.ec.illinois.edu/">visit their page.</a></p>

      <div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2 pure-u-lg-1-3 is-center">
        <h3 class="orange-text" id="corporate">Corporate Committee</h3>
        <p>The Corporate Committee is responsible for strengthening IEEE’s corporate relations and for providing opportunities to students to learn more about the companies that we network with. Most of our corporate contacts are acquired by approaching companies at the career fairs. The committee is in charge of hosting corporate events which mostly consist of info-sessions and tech-talks and luncheons. These events help improve the visibility of companies amongst students and make them aware of internship/job opportunities. In the past we have had events with Intel, Microsoft, Qualcomm, Northrop Grumman and NI, just to name a few. </p>

        <p>As a committee member, you will be in charge of communicating with some of our corporate contacts and setting up events with them. It is a great way to improve your networking skills and organizational ability. Through your communication with company representatives, you may even have the opportunity to acquire personal contacts within a company.</p>

        <h3 class="orange-text" id="networking">Networking Committee</h3>
        <p>This committee is new this year in that it is a consolidation of the previous Educational Events and Conferences committees. As such, it will put on various professional development events throughout the year, including Congressional Visits Day in the Spring. </p>

      <div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2 pure-u-lg-1-3 is-center">
        <h3 class="orange-text" id="external">External Relations Committee</h3>
        <p>The outreach committee aims at improving IEEEs relationship with EC (Engineering Council) and other RSOs (Registered Student Organizations) by hosting events and sharing resources. We will be working closely with all committees especially when help is required for co-hosting events such as Hackathons, social events, etc. Another goal is to work with other IEEE committees to coordinate events and seed projects.</p>

        <h3 class="orange-text" id="social">Social Committee</h3>
        <p>The IEEE social committee is where the fun is! We hold our meetings at Murphy’s Pub to plan social events for IEEE, which can sometimes be held with other engineering organizations like HKN or WECE.</p>

        <p>The goal of this committee and the social aspect of IEEE in general is to promote student camaraderie outside of the classroom and away from the books. We do this by hosting fun activities such as happy hours, bar crawls, athletic activities, and anything else you can think of that people would enjoy.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2 pure-u-lg-1-3 is-center">
        <h3 class="orange-text" id="spark">SPARK Committee</h3>
        <p>The Spark is a student-written magazine about student-led projects on campus from all disciplines of engineering. It also talks about how others can get involved in these activities. Additionally, we feature interviews with professors, an engineering society spotlight, and general news about the engineering campus.</p>

        <p>Topics for the articles are drawn from IEEE SEEDs and ACM Sigs, or contributed by student organizations including BMES, iGEM, EWB, AIAA, and many others. Also, if you’ve participated in EOH, we’d love to hear about your exhibit!</p>

        <p>We are always looking for people to help us compile the magazine! You can get involved by: </p>

        <ol>
          <li>collecting and editing articles</li>
          <li>doing graphic design and layout work</li>
          <li>writing your own article.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>If you are interested in journalism, technical writing, or worked for your high school newspaper, this is right place for you. That being said, no prior experience is required to perform any of the above activities, so all students are welcome to join. This is the perfect opportunity to gain extracurricular experience and improve your project organization skills.</p>

      <div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2 pure-u-lg-1-3 is-center">
        <h3 class="orange-text" id="awards">Awards Committee</h3>
        <p>The Awards Committee is in charge of recognizing excellence within and outside our IEEE branch and presenting outstanding individuals with awards. This committee is also in charge of seeking out awards for our IEEE branch as a whole. People of this committee should be willing to go to social and professional events in order to get to know their fellow IEEE members.</p>
