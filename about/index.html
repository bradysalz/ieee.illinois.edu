	  			<h3>What is IEEE?</h2>
	  			<hr />
	  			<p>The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, or IEEE, is the world’s leading professional association for the advancement of technology involving electricity. The purpose of IEEE as an organization is to disseminate knowledge of the theory and practice of all aspects of electrical, electronics, communications and computer engineering, as well as computer science, the allied Branches of engineering and the related arts and sciences. IEEE serves as a mean for students to further their professional and educational development.</p>

	  			<h3>IEEE @ UIUC Student Branch</h2>
	  			<hr />
	  			<p>The formation of University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign’s IEEE Student Branch took place in July 1947, the same year the transistor was invented by John Bardeen at Bell Labs. Back then, IEEE was called AIEE-IRE which was a joint organization between the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) and Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE). It wasn’t until 1963 when AIEE and IRE merged to form the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, known as IEEE.</p>

	  			<p>The student branch runs similarly to how it was run in its earlier years, though many of the board positions have changed and new roles added to accommodate new needs and the birth of the Internet. From September 1958 to August 1959, the Slate of Officers consisted of the Chairman, Vice-Chairman, Secretary, Treasurer, AIEE Corresponding Secretary, IRE Corresponding Secretary, and two Engineering Council Representatives. Today, the board looks much different, with the exception of the Secretary and Treasurer. We have combined some roles and created new ones, and will continue to serve branch members as best as possible.</p>

	  			<p>As a student organization, IEEE works closely with students on campus and different engineering organizations. Organizations that IEEE is continually involved with include Eta Kappu Nu (HKN) and Women in Electrical and Computer Engineering (WECE), though we are always willing to work with others. As a student, you’ll often find joint events between these societies.</p>

	  			<p>On the corporate side of things, IEEE is often contacted by companies interested in hosting seminars or sponsoring different activities. We offer a variety of packages to companies where we help set up a time and location for the event, and provide pizza and drinks to the students. Corporate sponsorship is especially helpful in making events and projects possible, such as the SEED program which lets students turn their project ideas into reality. The board is always brainstorming ideas to give companies the opportunity to meet students, obtain resumes, and advertise while letting students know about possible employers.</p>
